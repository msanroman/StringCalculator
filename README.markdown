String Calculator Kata
======================

In order to improve my coding skill, and my knowledge of **Ruby** and **Cucumber**, I'm practicing this kata.

I'm trying to put special attention to code *readability* and **reusability** (avoiding _magic numbers_, trying to __minimize__ method's length and trying to find **descriptive names** for everything).
